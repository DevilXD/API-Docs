# About
If you've ever looked over the API documentation for Paladins, it's...rough. Since the APIs are developed alike for Realm, Smite, and Paladins there is a lot of overlap and a lot of data that is not used. Hopefully we can work together to build a better and more robust documentation for the Paladins API.

All sections will be split up into their own folder, and categories in files below that.
