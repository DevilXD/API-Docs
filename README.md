# About
If you've ever looked over the API documentation for Paladins, it's...rough. Since the APIs are developed alike for Realm, Smite, and Paladins there is a lot of overlap and a lot of data that is not used. Hopefully we can work together to build a better and more robust documentation for the Paladins API.

All sections will be split up into their own folder, and categories in files below that.

You will see sections that look like the following:
> *This is some random text to give you an example of what it looks like*

This is pulled directly from the original documentation which can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OFS-3ocSx-1Rvg4afAnEHlT3917MAK_6eJTR6rzr-BM).
