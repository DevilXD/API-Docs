> *The purpose of this document is to provide SMITE API Developers and PALADINS API Developers with the necessary information to access and utilize the API methods.  The JSON data returned from the API methods is designed to be “self-documenting” and therefore detailed descriptions of each data field are not included in this API Developer Guide.*

A couple notes:
- The data is not very "self-documenting", no hate just isn't.
- It can be either XML or JSON depending on the format type you choose.
- Like stated in README and quote, these docs are written for SMITE and Paladins which can cause confusion for Paladins developers because it was originally developed for SMITE. Little things like `Total_Worshippers` for a SMITE developer makes sense but for a Paladins developer it doesnt. `Total_Worshippers` is total XP by the way.
