> *To access the APIs you'll need your own set of credentials which consist of a developer id (devId) and an authentication key (authKey).  The process of obtaining credentials should be a one-time activity.*
>
> *Here are the credentials for a sample account:*
>
> *DevId: 		(eg, 1004)*
>
> *AuthKey: 		(eg, 23DF3C7E9BD14D84BF892AD206B6755C)*
>
> *Use your personal credentials to access the api via a Representational State Transfer (REST) web service hosted at api.smitegame.com. Note that the same DevId/AuthKey combination should work for both SmiteAPI and PaladinsAPI, across all supported platforms.*

Note: The *service hosted* portion is inaccurate for Paladins and will be covered in the endpoints section.
