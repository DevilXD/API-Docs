For some weird reason, this isn't really discussed. Let's just quote the API Terms of Use...

>*If you are interested in creating an App that is paid and/or contains monetization features, please contact us at monetization_requests@hirezstudios.com to discuss a potential business relationship. All for-profit Apps must be pre-approved in writing by Hi-Rez (such approval to be granted or withheld in Hi-Rez's sole discretion). To the extent any for-profit Apps are approved in writing by Hi-Rez (in its sole discretion), you will be solely responsible for any and all taxes due in connection with the distribution of such App in any territory.*

So legal mumbo-jumbo aside, although I believe it's pretty straight forward, it's basically just saying if you plan on making direct income or selling any part of your app/website to people you have to obtain approval from them first. I do not believe this applies to on-site ads though, I could however be wrong.
