> *To begin using the API, you will first need to establish a valid Session. To do so you will start a session (via the createsession method) and receive a SessionId. Sessions are used for authentication, security, monitoring, and throttling. Once you obtain a SessionId, you will pass it to other methods for authentication. Each session only lasts for 15 minutes and must be recreated afterward.*
