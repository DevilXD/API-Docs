This will be similar to the original document, but I didn't want to quote it because I wanted to format it more.

To help maintain the stability of the API and prevent abuse/overuse, certain limitations have been placed on the API for developers. There may be a way where you can request larger limits, but as of right now I can not personally confirm this.

The current limits are:
- `concurrent_sessions`:  50
- `sessions_per_day`: 500
- `session_time_limit`:  15 minutes
- `request_day_limit`:  7500
